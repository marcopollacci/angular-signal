    state in your Solid application.
    They provide a way to store and update values, and are the foundation of reactivity in Solid.

    Signals can be used to represent any kind of state in your application, such as the current user, the current page,
    or the current theme.

    This can be any value, including primitive values such as strings and numbers, or complex values such as objects and
    arrays.
